## Overview
The Interactive Exercise Application is a web-based platform designed to offer users a series of interactive exercises, featuring multiple-choice questions and video-based content. It includes a progress indicator to visually track user advancement through the exercises.  For exercises that include timed questions, a countdown timer is integrated. If the timer expires before the exercise is completed, users are prompted with a message informing them that time is up, with an option to retry or restart the exercise. The platform is built with responsive design principles to ensure that it is accessible and functional across various devices and screen sizes

## Features Implemented
- **Multiple Choice Question Component**: Displays questions with radio buttons for answer selection. Highlights the selected answer and shows the choice below the question.
- **Video Exercise Component**: Embeds responsive videos in an iframe for video-based exercises.
- **Navigation Bar**: Provides 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons for navigating between exercises.
- **Progress Indicator**: Shows a visual progress bar with the percentage of completion based on the user's current position in the exercise series.
- **HTML Content Parsing**: Utilizes the DOMParser method to clean HTML tags from exercise titles and descriptions for a consistent UI.



- **MultipleChoiceQuestion.js**: Manages display and styling of multiple-choice questions.
- **Navbar.js**: Implements navigation with 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.
- **$exerciseId.jsx**: Main page for loading and rendering exercises based on fetched data.

## Approach
- **Component-based Architecture**: Employs reusable components for modular and maintainable code.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Uses the `loader()` function to fetch exercise data dynamically from a JSON file.
- **State Management**: Utilizes Reactâ€™s `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for managing state and cleaning HTML content.
- **Progress Indicator**: Calculates and displays user progress as a percentage.

## Potential Improvements
- **State Persistence**: Implement localStorage or backend database integration for saving user progress.
- **Responsive Design Enhancements**: Improve responsiveness for various screen sizes and devices.
- **Quiz Summary & Results Page**: Add a summary page for overall progress and feedback.
- **Timer and Exercise Deadline**: Introduce timers for timed challenges.
- **Backend Integration**: Connect to a backend API for dynamic content and user progress storage.
- **User Authentication**: Add user profiles for tracking progress across sessions.
- **Advanced Animations**: Enhance user experience with animations for progress and transitions.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility with ARIA labels and screen reader support.
- **Multiple Exercise Types**: Expand exercise types to include fill-in-the-blank, drag-and-drop, and coding exercises.
- **Leaderboard and Social Features**: Introduce leaderboards and social sharing to boost user engagement.
